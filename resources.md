# What Exactly Do You Want?
When I started out in data science back in 2015, I had no idea what I wanted. All I knew was that I had a dissertation to write for my degree in Economics, and that data science was the next big thing. I also knew that I liked programming and wanted to develop my skills in this area. I **did not** know nor expect to dive deep into data science. Many blog posts and one data science competition later (in 2019), I thought of pursuing an online Masters in Data Science to get certification of my skills. After much thought, I realised that these would have been what I would be paying for (in order of importance to me):  
  
#### 1. Knowledge
All Masters programmes equip their students with knowledge and practical experience.  
  
#### 2. Proof of Skills and Effort
The certificate is a declaration by a third party (a university) that I did attend certain courses and did well in them.  
  
#### 3. Quality Control
All of the above, under a formal, structured programme.  
  
#### 4. Brand
Apparently, a Masters degree at a reputable school means that the programme is respectable. Not entirely true, because data science is a young field, and Masters programmes are only younger.  
  
Having gone through the thought process, my recommendations are as such:  
  
1. If it is just **knowledge** you seek, go for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).
2. If it is **knowledge and proof of skills and effort** that you seek, go for *paid* MOOCs.
3. If it is **all of the above**, go for a Masters programme.  
  
Regardless of which option you chose, know that structure is important (and people love structure). Therefore, you should structure your learning, taking reference from Masters Programmes.
