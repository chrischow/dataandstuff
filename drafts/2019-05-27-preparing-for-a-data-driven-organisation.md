# Preparing for a Data-Driven Organisation
  
# Enough Foreplay
*"In the next bound of our transformation, [your organisation name] will exploit big data, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance [your organisation's value proposition]."* Yes, we've heard it all before. We will be able to do things faster, better, and more cost effectively. What's new? More importantly, *are we even moving?*
  
I think it is fair to say that everyone - the government, businesses, the layman - agree that data science is the future. Though I question the depth of understanding that people have of data science, I welcome their enthusiasm because I genuinely agree with their position on how important data science is and will be. With our leaders' heavy emphasis on building data science competencies in our economy, we have hopped on the bus toward a data-driven future. Whether people understand what data science truly is is besides the point. They will get there, because knowledge and skills can be acquired easily. What is difficult is adjusting to a data-driven culture. And that is the aim of this rare, no-code post: to ask the tough questions about our preparedness for a data-driven future.  
  
# A Hypothetical Case Study
We will use a simple hypothetical case study to tease out the potential points of tension in a data-driven organisation. Here's the pre-amble:  
  
Suppose you want to build a model to evaluate candidates for a position in your organisation. You mine the data on existing employees, and you find several intuitive features (columns) that were predictive of success: *course of study*, *age*, and *years of working experience*. However, it turns out that *gender*, *race*, and *sexual orientation* were on par in terms of predictive value. What's next?  
  
# Challenging Our Understanding
You have a high-level executive who has been in your organisation for a really long time. He is turning 250 million years old this year - essentially a dinosaur. DinoBoss thinks that academic grades must surely be important, and has bulldozed his way through multiple layers of executives below him, through mathematics and statistics, and through sound data science practices to insist that academic grades be included in the model. Through his sound business understanding, DinoBoss survived the asteroid, and saw the more successful of us develop from primates into humans only because we all got distinctions in our Masters degrees from Harvard. Therefore, we should include whatever DinoBoss says is right into our model because when DinoBoss knows, **he knows**, right?  
  
Leaders in a data-driven organisation will no longer have the luxury of convincing others through qualitative reasoning for all matters. With data, many things (though not all) can be quantified. And where there are true relationships between the data that you have and the phenomena you're trying to explain or predict, there is no escape from the quantitative reality that machine learning models can communicate. Therefore, we cannot operate with the same assumptions that we have today: that better grades *always* lead to success, that 

While I agree that it does somewhat represent intelligence and hard work, I think that there are many other ways to measure these qualities without confounding them. 

Fundamentally, if the model tells you that it doesn't matter, **then it doesn't fucking matter**. Whatever grades stand for could easily be diffused across the entire range of features in your model.
  
# Challenging Ways of Work and Life
Guess what: DinoBoss is back.

Machine learning can tell us a lot that we don't know about everyday tasks: how we hire, how we fire, and generally, how we operate. 

How prepared are we to accept that our current ways of operating are sub-optimal?
  
# Challenging Stereotypes
You apprise DinoBoss of your interesting finding that gender, race, and sexual orientation are useful in predicting success in the organisation. You also express your concern that this might be discriminatory. But DinoBoss has seen it **all** - the birds, the bees, the reptiles, the fish. They are the same: they are born, they live, they die. Therefore, discrimination does not matter, and he wants you to squeeze every last ounce of value from the data that the organisation has. After all, the organisation must select the best candidates at all cost, right?  
  
Absolutely not. Statements like that make me wish another asteroid was heading for earth. Discrimination should be prevented in any form and to any degree. The only way to ensure discrimination is not brought into a data-driven organisation is by being very cognisant of what we put into models and by **being very deliberate in choosing what we leave out**. The reason is that machine learning models don't know any better. There is no limit to how much they will discriminate, as long as the numbers are optimised. Therefore, the only way to prevent this from happening is to remove that opportunity altogether.  
  
People in data-driven organisations must be aligned on a common set of values to decide what is discrimination and what isn't. Surely choosing people by gender, race, and sexual orientation will be considered discrimination. What about social class? What about wealth? What about their proxies, like home address and type of housing? What about IQ?
