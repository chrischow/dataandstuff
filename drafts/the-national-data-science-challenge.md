# 4th Place Solution for the National Data Science Challenge
## Joining the National Data Science Challenge
It's been a crazy month. 9 months ago, I committed to having a baby, and Baby Ethan was born on 11 Mar 19! He has brought me so much joy, even through crying and pooping. Between the nappy changes and feedings, I committed to another baby: the National Data Science Challenge (NDSC) 2019, which was held from 23 Feb 19 to 22 Mar 19. I felt that participating in the NDSC was essential for me to develop my skills in data science and benchmark myself against other data scientists in Singapore. Hence, I teamed up with 3 ex-seniors from the University of Warwick to take a swing at the NDSC.  
  
## The Task
The NDSC was run by Shopee, who provided us with product listing titles and images on beauty, fashion, and mobile products. The task at hand was to predict attributes of these products. Here's the full list:
  
| Product Group | Attribute           |
|:-------------:|---------------------|
|     Beauty    | Benefits            |
|               | Brand               |
|               | Colour Group        |
|               | Product Texture     |
|               | Skin Type           |
