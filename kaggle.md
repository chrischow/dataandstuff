This page looks terribly empty now. However, in time, I plan to participate in many Kaggle competitions to hone my data science skills. For now, I have only one active competition.  
  
# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
The goal of this competition was to predict whether passengers survived or not. The broad approach I adopted was to develop a stacking model with a variety of machine learning algorithms. I optimised each machine learning model before feeding them into a select few models. Get the full story at the [official repository](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic).
